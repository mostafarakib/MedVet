    "paragraph": "Now that many people are home, some pets are not getting an adequate amount of exercise.  You can educate possible clients on how they can help their animals exercise even while at home. This is also a great opportunity to share proper exercise tips. Some pet owners might not know any better. Writing the proper way to do so can prevent a lot of exercise-related injuries among pets. You can also dish out advice on scheduling and the best type of exercise for a certain animal. For example, what might work best for dogs might not be ideal if someone owns a cat. It’s also important for owners to know that each pet will have individual exercise needs based on age, breed, weight, and preexisting health conditions. You can even post photos or videos of animals exercising on your practice’s Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account for some added visuals. Showing pet parents how it’s done can help ensure these tips are implemented properly."
