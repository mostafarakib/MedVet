    "title": "First-aid Tips for Pet Owners",
    "paragraph": "One of the most popular topics pet parents search for online is reliable first-aid tips to respond to common pet emergencies. From sprains to cuts, you can talk about how someone can save a pet’s life. This is a way to dish out important information a pet owner should know before rushing to the hospital. Of course, ideally, as veterinarians, you want them to head to you, but in reality, there are instances where first aid must be given immediately. Having a steady stream of blog posts covering the usual pet woes is a good way to help clients deal with emergencies. For example, if a pet owner calls your veterinary practice regarding one of the complications you’ve already discussed, you can even suggest that they visit your website to know how to handle the situation best. They might even share your blog as a resource for their pet community."

    "title": "Exercise Habits for Pets",
    "paragraph": "Now that many people are home, some pets are not getting an adequate amount of exercise.  You can educate possible clients on how they can help their animals exercise even while at home. This is also a great opportunity to share proper exercise tips. Some pet owners might not know any better. Writing the proper way to do so can prevent a lot of exercise-related injuries among pets. You can also dish out advice on scheduling and the best type of exercise for a certain animal. For example, what might work best for dogs might not be ideal if someone owns a cat. It’s also important for owners to know that each pet will have individual exercise needs based on age, breed, weight, and preexisting health conditions. You can even post photos or videos of animals exercising on your practice’s Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account for some added visuals. Showing pet parents how it’s done can help ensure these tips are implemented properly."

These kinds of tips can literally save the lives of dogs and cats. This is also a great way of marketing the veterinary medicine and supplements you offer. You can position them as ways for better pet care."
